<p>Hi Everyone! I'm very excited to learn more about Web design. I'm from the Dominican Public, but I currintly live in Taylorsville, Utah.
    I'm married to the love of my life and we have a daughter that will turn 2 years old this month.
    The things thta I love most about BYU-Idaho is that it allows me to get an education for a low cost and I have the blessing to get to know people from all over the world.
    I'm persuing a degree in applied tecnology, but I'm not sure yet in wich specific areas I would go into yet. I hope I can find out though my differnt classes.
    I been member of the church for about 20 years and I served a mission in my home country. One of my favorite scriptures is in 1 Nephi 3:7.
